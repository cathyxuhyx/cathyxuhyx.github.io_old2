- How do natural ravine and man-made hydro corridor affect the surrounding neighbourhoods?

I explored this through a thorough study of North Etobicoke region near the Mimico Creek in regards to the residential accessibility to the natural ravine and artificial hydro-corridor as well as the effect of vegetation barrier on sound levels. Through careful data collection, I found the noise levels are relatively high at where the ravine meets the major street.
